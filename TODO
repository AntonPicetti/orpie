rpc2 to-do list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely before release:

   * make sure all the rpc 0.98 functions are in rpc2 (gamma, pi, ...)

   * clean up the help panel; ideally, the hotkeys should be displayed
     in the main help window

   * fix the build script, so it (1) detects libgsl and (2) provides
     the proper optimization flags to the ocamlgsl compile process


* create a parser that can read data structures entered into an ascii file,
  so I can use $EDITOR to enter big matrices (for example)

* "'"  -> extended entry of a function (sin, cos, etc.), but
  "\"" -> extended entry of *any* command/operation (sin, cos, rad, rect, etc.)

* command completion (optionally) matches *only* operations that make sense
  in context.  e.g. sin() doesn't work on matrices, so it is not included in
  the extended entry completion list when the toplevel element is a matrix.

* try to clean up the rcfile syntax a bit, maybe by introducing modes

* implement rcfile macros
