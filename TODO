rpc2 to-do list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely before release:

   * make sure all the rpc 0.98 functions are in rpc2 (gamma, pi, ...)

   * clean up the help panel; ideally, the hotkeys should be displayed
     in the main help window

   * improve the build script (link directly with relevant portions of
     ocamlgsl-0.3.2, so the user will need only GSL and ncurses)

   * set the cursor to always be in the entry window, not jumping around
     as it is now

   * create an "about" function

   * change the name: "Orpie"?


* create a parser that can read data structures entered into an ascii file,
  so I can use $EDITOR to enter big matrices (for example)

* "'"  -> extended entry of a function (sin, cos, etc.), but
  "\"" -> extended entry of *any* command/operation (sin, cos, rad, rect, etc.)

* command completion (optionally) matches *only* operations that make sense
  in context.  e.g. sin() doesn't work on matrices, so it is not included in
  the extended entry completion list when the toplevel element is a matrix.

* see if interface can be refactored at all...  rpc_interface.ml is too big

* try to clean up the rcfile syntax a bit, maybe by introducing modes

* implement rcfile macros
