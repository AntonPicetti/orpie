rpc2 to-do list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fullscreen display of matrices should align all the columns

* "'"  -> extended entry of a function (sin, cos, etc.), but
  "\"" -> extended entry of *any* command/operation (sin, cos, rad, rect, etc.)

* command completion (optionally) matches *only* operations that make sense
  in context.  e.g. sin() doesn't work on matrices, so it is not included in
  the extended entry completion list when the toplevel element is a matrix.

* see if interface can be refactored at all...  rpc_interface.ml is too big

* try to clean up the rcfile syntax a bit, maybe by introducing modes

* implement rcfile macros
