Orpie To-Do List (roughly in order of priority)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add additional test cases for the rpc_calc object.  I could really use
  help with this; it's not difficult, just time-consuming.  Have a look
  at calc_test.ml if you're interested in lending a hand.  (Please grab
  the latest source from my Arch archive, as the test script may be changing
  rapidly in the near future.)

* add additional units

* add additional statistical functions (multivariate, distributions, ...)

* add finance functions

* refactor do_main_loop, draw_help, maybe other massive functions

* separate out UI from calculator object
   - Rpc_stack depends on Rcfile, which is really part of the UI
   - Rpc_stack.get_display_string() and related routines (arguably)
     should be provided as an interface module.  Rpc_stack could either
     pass data to the interface and let the interface worry about
     rendering, or (probably simpler) a rendering function could be
     passed to Rpc_stack at initialization time.

* i18n (maybe via http://saucecode.org/localcaml/ ?)

* try to improve general base conversion algorithm (decimal representation is 
  relatively slow at present)

* detect ill-conditioned complex matrices when performing inversion 
  (unfortunately GSL lacks a condition number estimator for complex 
  matrices)
