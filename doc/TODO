Orpie To-Do List (roughly in order of priority)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* test linear-time table lookup algorithm for power-of-two base conversions,
  and compare to current algorithm

* after all operations that create new data, launch a background thread that traverses
  the stack and fills in all unknown (i.e. None) strings, then exits

* try to improve general base conversion algorithm (decimal representation is 
  relatively slow at present)

* add statistical and financial functions

* detect ill-conditioned complex matrices when performing inversion

* "'"  -> extended entry of a function (sin, cos, etc.), but
  "\"" -> extended entry of *any* command/operation (sin, cos, rad, rect, etc.)

* command completion (optionally) matches *only* operations that make sense
  in context.  e.g. sin() doesn't work on matrices, so it is not included in
  the extended entry completion list when the toplevel element is a matrix
