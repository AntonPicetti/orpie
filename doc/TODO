Orpie To-Do List (roughly in order of priority)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* fix crash on autocomplete of variable names: it's a problem in draw_help
  when trying to highlight more letters than exist in a word

* fix display of the 'about' screen when the number of columns is < 80

* document the user-defined variable usage

* support parallel make (maybe use a hand-edited dependency tree to get around
  the ocamldep issues)

* detect ill-conditioned complex matrices when performing inversion

* "'"  -> extended entry of a function (sin, cos, etc.), but
  "\"" -> extended entry of *any* command/operation (sin, cos, rad, rect, etc.)

* command completion (optionally) matches *only* operations that make sense
  in context.  e.g. sin() doesn't work on matrices, so it is not included in
  the extended entry completion list when the toplevel element is a matrix.
