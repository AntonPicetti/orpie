Orpie To-Do List (roughly in order of priority)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* support parallel make (maybe use a hand-edited dependency tree to get around
  the ocamldep issues)

* detect ill-conditioned complex matrices when performing inversion

* "'"  -> extended entry of a function (sin, cos, etc.), but
  "\"" -> extended entry of *any* command/operation (sin, cos, rad, rect, etc.)

* command completion (optionally) matches *only* operations that make sense
  in context.  e.g. sin() doesn't work on matrices, so it is not included in
  the extended entry completion list when the toplevel element is a matrix.
