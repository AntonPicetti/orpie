Orpie To-Do List (roughly in order of priority)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add additional test cases for the rpc_calc object.  I could really use
  help with this; it's not difficult, just time-consuming.  Have a look
  at calc_test.ml if you're interested in lending a hand.  (Please grab
  the latest source from my Arch archive, as the test script may be changing
  rapidly in the near future.)

* add additional units

* add additional statistical functions (multivariate, distributions, ...)

* add finance functions

* try to improve general base conversion algorithm (decimal representation is 
  relatively slow at present)

* detect ill-conditioned complex matrices when performing inversion
